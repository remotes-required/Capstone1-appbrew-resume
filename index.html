    <p><h2>Summary</h2> <h3>I am new to web development. I have done many interesting things in my life, battled some health issues and came out relatively okay. 
        I am starting a new chapter and career after losing my left foot and coming back after covid. I have always been good with computers, the tech, the terminolgy, and now
        I am trying to get better at coding. I grew up in the age of computers. I have seen the begging of the internet for the public and loved every minute. I have seen 
        windows being rolled out, to dial up, Lime Wire, burning cds, myspace and more. Hopefully this technology I love will continue to advance and maybe I can make my
        mark somewhere in it's timeline.
