    <h1>About David Melton</h1>
    <p>
      Well I was born in Chester, SC. I had a good childhood, I was raised by my
      Maw maw Patricia and pretty much the whole family. My mom loved me and
      took care of me, but I mostly lived with my Maw maw, that's
      grandmother for those born in different parts of the country or other
      countries. We have our own vocabulary in the South. I grew up in the
      country, riding fourwheelers and dirtbikes, doing lots of manly
      stuff, like fixing cars and chopping wood. My real passion was computers,
      I was the first to get a PC and the internet and all the good stuff. 
      It was for my education, so I needed it. I got in and out of computers
      as time went on. <br />

      My teenage life brought me sorrow, My Maw maw passed away just as
      I entered High School. I went through a rebellious phase, but I endured
      and finished high school, but what now. I decided not to go to the
      local tech school or college just yet, i wanted to work and save some
      money, but as it goes for most young men, I met a girl, through the
      internet. We would talk a lot and eventually we considered
      ourselves a couple and decided since we only lived a few hundred miles
      from each other that I would move to Alabama and find a job. She was in
      her last year of school and we were in love. What happens when
      you're young and dumb, you get pregnant, or she did, I helped.

      We had this great kid, but we were broke. She just finished school
      and I had gotten into a little trouble trying to make ends meet. We
      decided to move closer to my mom where i could get a better job
      for the time being and she could go to college while I worked. That didn't
      go as planned. I went to work in construction for my stepdad and she went
      to work with my mom at her cleaning business. So now neither of us
      are in school, but at least we are working. We end up splitting up and I
      get my kid because she has an unstable life at the time, she still
      see's and helps with the kid, but he is mainly in my custody. My stepdad
      helps me get a job in the electrical field. <br />

      A few years later, my son is now in school and my mother watches
      him a lot when i have to work out of town, which is quite often. This gets
      to be rough on my son so i have to find a way to work in town and
      make as much money as I do now. My then girlfriend is working in the
      medical field and tells me of an upcoming class. It works out perfectly
      because Facebook is building a data center in town and the IBEW is
      contracted for parts of the job. I can work in town and go to school so
      when the in town work ends i can start in a new field. I move up by taking
      more classes and working with actual doctors, I love my new job.
      Que medical issues. I get diagnosed with kidney disease and have to go on
      dialysis, soon after COVID hits and i get another medical issue.
      My job shuts down the office I am working at and since I am on dialysis I
      can get disability and stay at home for a while. <br /><br />
      I end up losing my left foot due to my health issue. Then I lose
      my mom right before her birthday in 2023. I want to go back to work. I
      start thinking of my first passion, computers. I decide after all the work
      remote stuff from COVID, maybe I can get good at web development
      and computer science and I want to go back to work, so now here I am,
      learning and trying to change my life. My son Graduates this year, I want
      him to see you can do anything you put your mind too. <br>
